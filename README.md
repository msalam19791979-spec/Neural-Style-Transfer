*OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:- NEURAL STYLE TRANSFER*

üéØ Objective of the Task:
To implement a Neural Style Transfer (NST) model that applies artistic styles to photographs using deep learning techniques.

üîë Key Points:
Neural Style Transfer Model:

Develop a model that can blend artistic styles (like famous paintings) with real photographs.

This involves using techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Application of Artistic Styles:

The model should be able to transform input images by applying the style of another image (e.g., turning a photo into a Van Gogh-style painting).

Deliverable:

A Python script or Jupyter Notebook.

Must include examples of styled images (input + output).

üìù Activities to be Performed:
Research and understand how neural style transfer works.

Set up the required environment (likely using libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow).

Implement the NST model.

Test it on multiple images to produce stylized outputs.

Submit the Python script or notebook as the final deliverable.
